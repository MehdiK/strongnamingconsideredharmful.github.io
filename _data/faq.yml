- question: "But [cool open source project] doesn't have strong naming and I need it in my enterprise app that I absolutely need to sign..."
  answer: |
    Don't hassle the developer to sign their project just so you can use it. There are several workarounds that you can use:

    - Use `ILDASM` and `ILASM` to sign the assemblies after the fact *examples please*
    - Use Git submodules to fork the project into your project and build it yourself *examples please*
    - *anything else?*
